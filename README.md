What is NumPy? 

NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. 

It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is open-source software. 

It contains various features including these important ones:

-> A powerful N-dimensional array object

-> Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions

-> Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code

-> Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities


Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. 

Arbitrary data-types can be defined using Numpy which allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
